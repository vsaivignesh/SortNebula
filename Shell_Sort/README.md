shell sort: In shell sort, an interval h is defined. elements at positions i and i+h are compared
and swapped if list[i]>list[i+h]. 
the interval is halved and the algorithm is run again. This occurs till h=1. 
Aat h=1, insertion sorting is done. In shell sort, the amount of swaps required will be lesser and 
thus will be quicker than normal insertion sort.
